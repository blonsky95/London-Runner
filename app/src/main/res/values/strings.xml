        London has to offer, including the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, the London Eye, Big Ben
        and the Houses of Parliament. It is completely flat and mainly along the waterfront thus
        avoiding some street traffic. This route is best run early in the morning or in the winter
        to avoid heavy tourist traffic. You’ll want to plan an easy run so you can take your time
        to enjoy the historic landmarks and stop for pictures. The distance can be varied by
        selecting a different bridge to cross the river, try the Millennium Bridge for a shorter
        loop or the Battersea for a longer run.</string>

        paved and dirt surfaces. Our route adds on Green Park and St. James Park as well to take you
        past Buckingham Palace, the Horse Guards Parade, and the Mall. This route is flat and nearly

        workout as it boasts a variety of terrain as well as an athletic track and swimming in the
        lido or ponds. This route takes you around the perimeter of the Heath and starts at the
        track where there are public shower facilities. After this short loop why not finish your

    <string name="type3_4_desc">Richmond Park, the largest of the Royal Parks, is a countryside
        treasure within the city of London. A short trip from central London has you running on
        hilly dirt trails through forests and fields. The most popular route in Richmond Park is
        the perimeter loop on the Tamsin Trail but a network of trails offer countless options.
        If you venture in to the heart of the park you will likely meet some of the deer that live
        there. Toilets, water fountains and cafes are plentiful, making Richmond Park the ideal
        place for any type of run. Our route starts and finishes at the Roehampton Gate where you
        will find a café for a post-run snack. For a more formal lunch try the Pembroke Lodge.</string>

    <string name="type3_5_address">East London</string>
    <string name="type3_5_desc">This mostly traffic-free, flat, paved route takes you on a tour of
        East London via four different towpaths along London’s historic canals – the Limehouse Cut,
        River Lea, Hertford Union and Regent\'s Canals. Starting from the redeveloped Limehouse Basin
        you will run past narrowboats and locks, over and under bridges and even get a peek at the
        Olympic Park. You’ll find a variety of scenery along your way from industrial buildings to
        manicured parks. Highlights include the floating towpath on the Limehouse Cut, the Olympic
        Stadium, Victoria Park, and Mile End Park. You might try a detour through the meandering
        paths of Mile End Park or extend this route by continuing along the Thames.</string>

        public playground featuring open fields, gardens, a running track, restrooms, cafés, and
        the London Zoo. The paved paths through beautiful Regent\'s Park are a great place for a
        flat tempo run but we also like to run up Primrose Hill which some say rivals Parliament
        Hill for views of London. We start and finish this run near the Hub, which has locker and
        shower facilities, a café, and even offers exercise classes if you want to spice up your
        training.</string>

        historic Victoria Park. “Vicky Park”, as it is known locally, boasts pretty, tree-lined,
        paved paths, as well as restrooms, cafés, and plenty of other runners. After a lap around
        the park we add on an out and back along Regent\'s Canal to the arched Acton Mews Bridge.
        The towpath alongside Regent’s Canal is also a popular place for running in London as it
        allows you to run off-road for over 14 km from Little Venice to Limehouse Basin. Our route
        starts from the Crown Gates where you will find the Pavilion Café if you are in need of
        refreshment after your run.</string>

        paved Carriage Drive loop around Battersea Park and the running track at Millennium Arena
        are both excellent locations for your weekly speed work. In addition to the 8-lane track,

        Britain. We have 2245 members of whom 43% are women. We have a wide variation of ages:
        a few juniors, many young people, a few in their eighties and everything in-between.
        However, although we are large, we like to think we retain a friendly, small club atmosphere
        and always welcome newcomers.
Our roots were in road running but these days our members take part in all sorts of sporting
        activities loosely related to running. We compete in road races all year round. Additionally,
        in the winter we also do cross country, taking part in two leagues, as well as in County and
        National Championships; and in summer, we have men's and women's track &amp; field teams in the
        Southern Athletics League, the vets league, and the Rosenheim league. The other major focus
        in summer of course is triathlon and duathlon racing, with members competing at every
        distance (in fact several hundred club members only ever compete in multi-sport). We have
        several members who have competed at international level for England and other nations in
        running, track &amp; field, duathlon and triathlon competitions.</string>

        In order to encourage runners of all abilities, the club has had a long standing policy of
        frequently \'turning back\' to pick up those running at the back of the pack. If you have any
        doubts about whether you can keep up with the pace, or of dropping off the back and getting
        lost, fear not, we won't leave you behind!
If you are interested in joining us come along to one of our sessions and speak to whoever is
        leading the run. You are welcome to run with us for a few weeks before formally joining
        and paying your subscription</string>
