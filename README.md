# London-Runner
Android app for London runners to locate tracks and running routes as well as connecting with other runners. Currently in development.
The app gathers information on every outdoor and indoor track in London, providing the user a shortcut to finding places in which to 
go for a run or train. The app uses Location services to show the user the closest facilities from their location. 

Next stage is to add training groups to tracks as well as independently so runners can find other athletes with which to train.
